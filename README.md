# Student Academic Performance Analysis (ML)

## Introduction
Student academic performance is influenced by multiple academic and personal factors. Analyzing these factors helps in understanding learning patterns and improving educational outcomes. This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques to examine student performance data, uncover meaningful insights, and build predictive models that estimate academic results based on key features.

## Dataset
- Student Academic Performance Dataset (CSV)
- Contains academic and student-related attributes

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Feature Engineering  
- Machine Learning Model Training  
- Model Evaluation  


## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into the factors affecting student academic performance. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling, the project successfully demonstrated how student outcomes can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. This work highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in education and shows how machine learning can support better academic planning and decision-making.
